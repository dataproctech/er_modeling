In previous two lectures I showed in practice how to do conceptual and ER modeling in MySQL Workbench and pgAdmin4 tools. I did this with two examples: 1)  Library Management System (MySQL Workbench) 2) University Enrollment System (pgAdmin4)

Task for you: do the same, but for Online Shopping System.

Detailed step-by-step guide what you should do:
1) Define entities, attributes, relations, constraits.
2) Create ER-diagram.
3) From ER-diagram generate DB Schema (SQL Script).
4) Configure Database connection, Connect to Database.
5) Execute the SQL Script.
6) Verify the Database Schema by reviewing tables and relationships.
7) Test the schema by inserting data and running queries.
